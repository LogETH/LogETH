Wassup, im Log (You might know me from discord) ðŸ‘‹

I like creating dapps for fun! Decentralized Apps that work to provide a service, not to make money,

The concept of decentralized software is really interesing in my eyes, an application that nobody owns, but everyone can use. Immutable, permissionless, decentralized.
